# NZ Hansard Scraper

Some basic scripts for scraping data from the [New Zealand Parliament Hansard Reports](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/).

Currently just extracts data/transcripts for oral questions.

Not really suitable for general use, but the code might be useful for anyone else trying to get Hansard data.
